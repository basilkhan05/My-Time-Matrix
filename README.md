# [My Time Matrix](http://basilkhan.ca/projects/mytimematrix/) - [Basil Khan](http://basilkhan.ca/)<br>
This simple app uses AJAX, PHP and mySQL databases to store your to-do lists in a time matrix and save them in the database as the user types (with the help of AJAX) without a save button. The app also uses a simple login form and keeps the user logged in with the help of coookies.

More revisions, better layout and features to come!
